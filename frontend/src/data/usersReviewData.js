      "Tastes great, nice energy boost. I read about people complaining about the Lime flavor (?) It's great. Remember the lime popsicles as a kid? That's the taste. Then again, why whine about flavor when it's a supplement? Down it and get on with your workout! I didn't have any side effects with this, no jitters or anything, and I drink a LOT of coffee throughout the day. On some days I'll do the recommended dosage, some days I use less. Experiment with it. Anyone looking to this (or any supplement) thinking it's going to magically make you lose weight? Sorry. You need to get off your butt, workout, and stop eating garbage. The Ripper is a tool, like other supplements that give a boost to your workouts and rev up your metabolism a bit. Hit the workout with intensity and focus, cut out empty carbs and yes, supplements will work for you. I'd buy this again.",
